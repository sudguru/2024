This code is a Python script that uses Google OR-Tools to solve a shift scheduling problem. The goal is to assign shifts to employees over a period of weeks, taking into account various constraints and objectives to optimize the schedule. Here's a summary of the key components:
Data

    Employees: The number of employees is fixed at 8.
    Weeks: The schedule spans 3 weeks.
    Shifts: There are 4 types of shifts: Off, Morning, Afternoon, and Night.
    Fixed Assignments: Some shifts are pre-assigned to employees for specific days.
    Requests: Employees have preferences or requirements for certain shifts on specific days, which can be positive (preference) or negative (requirement).
    Shift Constraints: There are constraints on the minimum and maximum number of consecutive days for certain shifts, with penalties for not meeting these constraints.
    Weekly Sum Constraints: There are constraints on the total number of shifts per week for each shift type, with penalties for not meeting these constraints.
    Penalized Transitions: There are penalties for transitioning between certain shifts.
    Weekly Cover Demands: There are demands for each shift type per day of the week.

Constraints

    Exactly One Shift Per Day: Each employee must be assigned exactly one shift per day.
    Fixed Assignments: Some shifts are fixed for specific employees and days.
    Shift Constraints: There are constraints on the minimum and maximum number of consecutive days for certain shifts, with penalties for not meeting these constraints.
    Weekly Sum Constraints: There are constraints on the total number of shifts per week for each shift type, with penalties for not meeting these constraints.
    Penalized Transitions: There are penalties for transitioning between certain shifts.
    Cover Constraints: There are constraints on the total number of employees needed for each shift type per day, with penalties for not meeting these constraints.

Objectives

    Minimize Penalties: The objective is to minimize the total penalties associated with not meeting the constraints. This includes penalties for not meeting shift constraints, weekly sum constraints, penalized transitions, and cover constraints.

Solving the Problem

The script defines a model using the cp_model.CpModel class from OR-Tools. It then adds constraints and objectives to the model based on the data and requirements. The model is solved using the cp_model.CpSolver class, with the solution being printed out. The script also supports writing the model to a proto file for further analysis or modification.
Key Functions

    negated_bounded_span: Helper function to create a sequence of negated Boolean variables with optional bounds.
    add_soft_sequence_constraint: Adds a constraint that penalizes sequences of true variables that are too short or too long.
    add_soft_sum_constraint: Adds a constraint that penalizes sums of true variables that are too low or too high.
    solve_shift_scheduling: The main function that sets up the model, adds constraints and objectives, solves the model, and prints the solution.

This script demonstrates how to use Google OR-Tools for complex scheduling problems, showcasing the use of Boolean variables, constraints, and objectives to optimize schedules under various constraints.
