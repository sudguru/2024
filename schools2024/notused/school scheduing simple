Using Minizinc, I am trying to create a model to create a monthly teacher schedule in a school.

I have following facts and constraints.

There are two classes: One and Two. 

There is a fixed classroom allocated for each class. In above example we have 2 classrooms. Each class is taught in the same room. (so room is not the issue)

Each class has a certain number of subjects.
Class One has English, Math, Science, Art
Class Two has English, Math, Science, Art, GK


Maximum number of periods that can be allocated for a subject for a class in a week is given.
Class One English = 100, Nepali = 100, Science = 100, Art = 2
Class Two English = 100, Nepali = 100, Science = 100, Art = 2, GK = 1
Of course it doesn't mean there should be 100 English periods in week, its just maximum that can be allocated.

Each day there are 3 periods. In each period one teacher teaches one subject. A teacher can not be assigned two classes at the same period. A teacher must have at least one free period for resting. 
There are known number of teachers and what they teach in which class is also known. 

There is a special Teacher UNKONWN who can teach all subjects in all classes. But he should be assigned classes only if there is no other teacher available.

Example:
Teacher1: English in Class One and Two
Teacher2: Math in Class One and Two
Teacher3: Science in Class One and Two, GK in Class Two
Teacher4: Art in Class One and Two

The task is to create schedule.

Format of the output should be like this:

Class	Day 	1stPeriod 		2ndPeriod		3rdPeriod 	
One	Sun	Teacher1/English	Teacher2/Math		Teacher3/Science
One	Mon	Teacher1/English	Teacher2/Math		Teacher3/Science
One	Tue	Teacher1/English	Teacher2/Math		Teacher3/Science
One	Wed	Teacher1/English	Teacher2/Math   	Teacher3/Science
One	Thu	Teacher1/English	Teacher2/Math   	Teacher3/Science
One	Fri	Teacher4/Art		Teacher2/Math    	Teacher3/Science
Two	Sun	Teacher2/Math		Teacher3/Science	Teacher1/English
Two	Mon	Teacher2/Math		Teacher3/Science	Teacher1/English
Two	Tue	Teacher2/Math		Teacher3/Science	Teacher1/English
Two	Wed	Teacher2/Math		Teacher3/Science   	Teacher1/English
Two	Thu	Teacher3/GK        	Teacher4/Art	   	Teacher4/Art
Tw9	Fri	Teacher2/Math		Teacher3/Science    	Teacher1/English

Can you do it? Using MiniZinc.
