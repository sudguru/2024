Using Minizinc, I am trying to create a model to create a monthly teacher schedule in a school.

Here is the format of the output:

Class		Day 	1stPeriod 		2ndPeriod 	etc ...
Class One A	Sun	Teacher1/English	Teacher2/Math
...
Class One B	Sun 	Teacher2/Math		Teacher1/English
...
Class Two	Sun	Teacher3/Science	Teacher4/Math

I have following facts and constraints.

There are 10 Grades. Each Grades has one or more sections. Lets say we have the following classes and sections.

Clas One A, Class One B, Class Two, Class Three, Class Four, Class Five, Class Six, Class Seven, Class Eight A, Class Eight B, Class Nine, Class Ten.

There is a fixed classroom allocated for each class. In above example we have 12 classrooms. Each class is taught in the same room. (so room is not the issue)

Each class has a certain number of subjects. subjects are same for all sections of a given class. Class One A has same subjects as of Class One B. 

Also, subjects have credit hours. Amount of periods in a month should be allocated according to the credit hours of a given subject. But at least one period should be allocated to a subject no matter how small its credit hours compared to others.

Each day there are 7 periods. In each period one teacher teaches one subject. A teacher can not be assigned two classes at the same period. A teacher must have at least one free period for resting. Generally a teacher teaches same subject in the class he is assigned to, but sometime he may teaches another similar subject as well. A range of classes a teacher teaches must not exceed 6, which means a teacher who teaches in class One may teach in class 6 but can not teach in class 7.

Here is the example of class subjects and credit hours.

Class	Subject			Credit_Hours
One	English I		100
One	Nepali			100
One	Math			100
One	Science			100
One	Social Studies		100
One	Health			 50
One	General Knowledge	 50
One	English II		 50
One	Nepali II		 50
One	English Writing		 10
One	Nepali Writing		 10
One	Art			 50
One	Spoken			 20
Two	English			100
Two	Nepali			100
Two	Math			100
Two 	Science			100
Two	Social Studies		100
Two	Moral Studies		100
Two	General Knowledge	50	
Two	Art			50
Two	English Writing		10
Two	Nepali Writing		10
Two	Spoken			20

The solution should optimize the number of teachers. In Grades Above 7, a teacher who teaches a subject with 100 credit hours can not teach another subject with 100 credit hours.

Can you do it? Using MiniZinc.
